## 🎯 Project Overview

FoodIO is a responsive food service website built in HTML and CSS, now evolving into a full-stack MERN-style application. The goal: create an intuitive, scalable platform where users can browse, select, and interact with menu items—while contributors grow as developers and collaborators.

### What Makes FoodIO Special?
- **Frontend-first learning**, with clean UI and accessible design  
- **Modular backend architecture** using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB  
- **Real-world patterns**, including API creation, routing, authentication  
- **Open source mentorship**, structured for growth under GSSoC 2025

## 🎨 Frontend Breakdown

FoodIO’s UI is designed for clean layout, responsive design, and beginner accessibility.

### Key Features
- Semantic HTML tags for structure and clarity  
- CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout  
- Accessibility improvements (e.g., `alt` attributes)  
- Planned features: dark mode, animations, hover effects  

### Recommended Enhancements
- Sticky navbar, scroll behavior  
- Component-based CSS organization  
- Dynamic menu rendering using JavaScript

## 🔧 Backend Breakdown

Now expanding into Express + MongoDB-based backend APIs to power FoodIO with dynamic content.

### Key Backend Features
- Express server with modular routing  
- MongoDB schema for food items  
- Basic CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`)  
- Future: JWT authentication, order tracking, admin dashboard  

### Sample API Route
```js
// GET all foods
GET /api/foods

// POST new food item
POST /api/foods
{
  "name": "Veg Thali",
  "price": 120,
  "category": "Indian",
  "description": "A wholesome meal with rice, dal, sabzi, and chapati"
}
```
